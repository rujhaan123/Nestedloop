Challenge3

We have built a function by which we will get the key value pairs from a nested dictionary. We can pass the key and get its corresponding value. This specific code has been written in Python language

Programme Flow

1. We started iterated with all the items that we have in nested dictionary and print the first key
2. Then we are iterating against the corresponding value that we got from the first key, it can be a simple value or it can also be another key value pair.
3. After that we again iterated for the corresponding values for the key obtained in 2nd iteration and printed both the key value pairs.
4. We can print both keys and values in any iteration, same object has been used for test as defined in the challenge statement.
